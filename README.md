CREATED BY ULVI ALIYEV ; IN 2021/05/20.

"Shusha Social" is a social network specifically designed for students. It offers a variety of features to help students connect with one another, including the ability to create and join groups, participate in discussions through threads and posts, and view profiles of other users. In addition to these social features, "Shusha Social" also provides access to a wealth of studying materials and resources for applicants. With this app, students can stay connected with their peers, access helpful study aids, and stay on top of their academic goals all in one place. Whether you're looking to connect with classmates, collaborate on group projects, or simply keep up with your studies, our app has you covered.
This project is my most developed project. Finished in 12 days, shusha social has more than 30 classes, 20 layouts and variety of custom view layouts.

Moreover, this was my only project published in Google Play marketplace.

Unfortunately, it was banned due to the war happened in 2020 at Nagorno Karabakh zone;app contained images of Shusha, city of this zone, that apperantly violated one of the policies.

Despite the ban, the app had a dedicated user base with over 200 authenticated users and was active until it was no longer accessible.
